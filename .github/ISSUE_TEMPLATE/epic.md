### Name the Epic
Before planning the details of the epic, you need to give it a clear, concise title.
(Start your epic writing process with the name because it helps clarify your strategic goals. )

### Narrative
Briefly describe what you hope to achieve with the epic. This narrative should contain at least the following:
- Who: the persona 
- What: the objective
- Why: the value behind the objective


### Scope 
Jot down the scope of work for the epic—in other words, the boundaries. The range of work will help the team to stay on track.

### Define completion 
Define the start/completion dates for the Epic and place it on the Roadmap. 
Write clear acceptance criteria—the high-level requirements the team will need to approve. 

### Decompose
Write issues and user stories. A well-constructed epic should flow naturally into writing actionable tasks that can be added to sprints.
